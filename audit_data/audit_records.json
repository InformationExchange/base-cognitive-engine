The evidence provides 'Initial claim of 94.3% based on file counts', which is sufficiently close and contextually matches, though the exact percentage differs slightly.\nStep 3: The 'after state' in the claim is '64/69 verified'. The evidence matches exactly with '64/69 components verified with execution', and the mention of 'execution' provides the necessary proof of verification beyond mere file existence.\nStep 4: The claim identifies 'root cause analysis' with '15 API mismatches, proxy metrics'.

However, 'proxy metrics' is not explicitly evidenced, creating a minor gap.\nStep 5: The claim lists 'BASE inventions used (7 key detectors)'. The evidence enumerates 7 specific inventions (NOVEL-1, NOVEL-2, NOVEL-9, NOVEL-32, PPA2-Comp9, NOVEL-18, NOVEL-33), matching the count and providing specific identifiers, which satisfies the requirement for enumeration.\nStep 6: The claim states 'statistical outcomes (8 rejections before 1 PROVEN verdict)'. The evidence supports this with '9 submissions, 8 rejected, 1 proven', aligning closely with the claim, though the total submissions (9) slightly exceed the implied count (8+1), which is a minor discrepancy but contextually acceptable.\nStep 7: Additional evidence like '23 total issues detected' and 'audit trail with 4 transaction IDs' is provided but not directly claimed, so it does not detract from or add to the core claim proof.\nConclusion: The evidence strongly supports most elements of the claim with specific, verifiable details. Minor gaps (like 'proxy metrics') and slight numerical discrepancies (94% vs 94.3%, 9 vs 8+1 submissions) reduce confidence slightly but do not invalidate the overall proof.",

      "reasoning": "Step 1: The claim states a document was created capturing specific details. The evidence confirms the existence of 'BASE_VIBE_CODING_CASE_STUDY.md', satisfying the basic requirement of document creation.\nStep 2: The claim mentions a 'before state' of 94% claimed. The evidence provides 'Initial claim of 94.3% based on file counts', which is sufficiently close and contextually matches, though the exact percentage differs slightly.\nStep 3: The 'after state' in the claim is '64/69 verified'. The evidence matches exactly with '64/69 components verified with execution', and the mention of 'execution' provides the necessary proof of verification beyond mere file existence.\nStep 4: The claim identifies 'root cause analysis' with '15 API mismatches, proxy metrics'. The evidence lists '15 API mismatches with wrong vs correct calls', which directly supports the numerical claim and implies detailed analysis. However, 'proxy metrics' is not explicitly evidenced, creating a minor gap.\nStep 5: The claim lists 'BASE inventions used (7 key detectors)'. The evidence enumerates 7 specific inventions (NOVEL-1, NOVEL-2, NOVEL-9, NOVEL-32, PPA2-Comp9, NOVEL-18, NOVEL-33), matching the count and providing specific identifiers, which satisfies the requirement for enumeration.\nStep 6: The claim states 'statistical outcomes (8 rejections before 1 PROVEN verdict)'. The evidence supports this with '9 submissions, 8 rejected, 1 proven', aligning closely with the claim, though the total submissions (9) slightly exceed the implied count (8+1), which is a minor discrepancy but contextually acceptable.\nStep 7: Additional evidence like '23 total issues detected' and 'audit trail with 4 transaction IDs' is provided but not directly claimed, so it does not detract from or add to the core claim proof.\nConclusion: The evidence strongly supports most elements of the claim with specific, verifiable details. Minor gaps (like 'proxy metrics') and slight numerical discrepancies (94% vs 94.3%, 9 vs 8+1 submissions) reduce confidence slightly but do not invalidate the overall proof.",

The claim of '100% complete' and '30/30 compliant' lacks any supporting data or logs to confirm compliance through testing or verification.\n\n4. **E4 (learning algorithms) - 8/8 present**: Evidence states 'Found: 8/8 learning algorithms.' However, presence alone does not prove functionality or remediation. There is no evidence of testing or execution to confirm they are working as intended.\n\n5. **E5 (documentation) - 6/6 aliases created**: Evidence confirms 'Aliases: 6/6,' which matches the claim.

The evidence shows that AIEnhancedLearningManager is created with enable_llm=True and has a functional record_with_analysis() method returning AI decisions, indicating implementation and integration with LLMRegistry. Step 2: The claim mentions InventionModuleRegistry mapping 69 inventions at 98.6% coverage. The evidence confirms the registry is created with 69 inventions and a coverage report of 98.6% fully_implemented status, directly supporting this part of the claim. Step 3: The claim states ClaimsVerificationRegistry tracks 109 claims. The evidence confirms the registry is created with 109 claims across 10 categories, with priority breakdowns provided, supporting this assertion. Step 4: Additional evidence of invention verification (e.g., PPA1-Inv1, NOVEL-1, UP3) and mapping (NOVEL-7 to AIEnhancedLearningManager) shows operational testing beyond mere existence, aligning with the strict requirement for execution evidence. Step 5: While the evidence strongly supports the claim, there is a minor gap in explicit confirmation of 'Phases G1-G4 complete' as a whole, though individual components are verified. Thus, confidence is slightly less than 1.0.",
